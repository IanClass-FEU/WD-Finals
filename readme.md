## Overview

Personal Website v.2: A Showcase of Design and Functionality

This project is a personal website designed to demonstrate my proficiency in web development and design. It features a collection of five distinct pages, each showcasing unique layouts and interactive elements created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website includes sections such as a resume detailing my skills and experience, a project showcase with links to repositories and descriptions, and an overview page explaining its purpose and content. Deployed using GitHub Actions, this project emphasizes clean code, responsive design, and a user-friendly experience.

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```
